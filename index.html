        <h4>How dangerous is COVID-19</h4>
        <img src="images/Covid19-1.png" class="card-img-fluid" alt="Covid-19"   >
        <p>Most people will have mild symptoms and get better on their own. But about 1 in 6 will have severe problems, such as trouble breathing. The odds of more serious symptoms are higher if youâ€™re older or have another health condition like diabetes or heart disease.</p>
        <p>The risk of death from COVID increases with age, but researchers have found that the upward curve grows exponentially steeper with every extra decade.</p>
        <p> One out of every 800 people entering early middle age at 45 will die from their COVID infection, 55-year-olds have a 1 in 240 risk of dying if they contract the coronavirus, and 65-year-olds have a 1 in 70 chance, said lead researcher Andrew Levin, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H.</p>
        <p>By comparison, people who are 25 have a 1 in 10,000 risk of dying from COVID, and 35-year-olds have a 1 in 2,700 chance, Levin said.</p>
        <p>The new analysis found that a middle-aged American's risk of death from a COVID-19 infection is many times greater than their risk of dying in a car crash, Levin added.</p>
        <p>People between 45 and 55 die nearly 18 times more often from COVID-19 than from an auto wreck, according to the study, while those aged 55 to 64 are almost 58 times more likely to die from a COVID infection than a crash.</p>
